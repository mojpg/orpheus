Hello world! My name is Mo Zebdi, and this is my home on the internet.

I am a Computer Science major and Linguistics minor at UMich.  My main academic interests lie in information security, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics.  Practically speaking, I am comfortable in C/C++, Python, Bash scripts, CSS, and HTML, and have plenty of practice building, configuring, and managing Unix/Linux servers.

In the realm of computational linguistics, I am familiar with the NLTK Python library for linguistic and sentiment analysis, as well as writing basic context-free and feature grammars and models of language parsing.

With regards to devops and team leadership skills, I am capable with Scrum methodologies, Agile development, Jira, Docker, Git workflows, some continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) technologies, and cloud-based deployment infrastructure such as DigitalOcean and AWS.

This website is an ongoing project. I will be adding more facilities in the near future.

You can email me at mo (at) (this domain), or mozebdi (at) umich (dot) edu.
