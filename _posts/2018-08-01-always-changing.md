Change is inevitable, said someone much wiser than myself.  I think they're right.  This blog is a decent example of the inevitability of change -- if you take a look at the GitHub repo, you'll probably notice some changes and tweaks.  Nothing is perfect, so I constantly change things in pursuit of improvement.

Yes, this is a somewhat ADHD philosophy.  No, it hasn't always served me well.  But on the bright side, it keeps my life interesting.  

Speaking of change, I changed my site's hosting again -- now it's free static hosting from Netlify.  Saving those DigitalOcean credits for senior year projects seems like a more fiscally responsible move.

And speaking of hosting: I'm back to working on fun Docker-based side projects!  This time, I'm deploying Phabricator and Rocket.Chat for the Inter-Cooperative Council of Ann Arbor.  This is a significantly more involved process than the learning experience I had with deploying a NextCloud server for my personal use, which didn't exactly pan out the way I wanted it to.  I ended up mothballing the project due to network reliability issues -- a pitfall of hosting a data-hungry sync service on a consumer-grade link.

Fortunately, with the lessons I've gleaned from the #devops lifestyle at JSTOR, as well as my previous experience with Docker, I feel confident in my ability to pull this thing together.  On the flip side, though, I'll have to convince non-technical users to use Kanban boards, a wiki, and a chat app... which hasn't succeeded in the past, seeing as Slack adoption is near-zero within the ICC.  It'll probably be easier to persuade students and house leaders to join up, then use that momentum to lead a technological revolution from the ground up.  

Yay, I'm sounding more and more like a hopelessly na√Øve tech evangelist by the day.  Only time will tell if my confidence is justified, though... and it's always worth the effort to make positive change.  Plus, every failure is an opportunity to learn, so even if this flops hard, I've still learned a ton about deploying LAMP-stack apps, the intricacies of Bitnami Stacks, and why docker-compose files are so flaky.  Plus, I'm becoming a better Linux sysop every day I spend bashing my head against weird config issues...

Well, time to get back to the grind and continue crushing it, whatever "it" is supposed to be.  Probably cans of Diet Dr. Pepper.

Signing off,

PS: if you're reading this and you're even vaguely considering hiring me: yes, I'm probably interested.  Check out my resume, to be refreshed when my internship ends at the end of August.  And feel free to spam me with LinkedIn messages, which I read and respond to, unless they seem extremely shady.
