So this is my first blog post on here.  Kind of a neat little project, if you ask me.  I'm actually hosting the entire site myself, on my own machine, and managing that has proven to be a fun challenge at times, and a frustrating one at others.  

I'll be using this blog to write up my thoughts on technology, politics, and any interesting projects I may be working on. Updates will most likely be sporadic, because I don't have that much free time for blogging.


Feel free to explore my resume and about pages - they are very informative.
