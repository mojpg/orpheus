After some temporary downtime due to moving -- yes, in real life -- the site is back up! Bonus: it is now hosted on DigitalOcean instead of on a local machine, which means it'll be more stable and not reliant on any network admin's approval to remain online.

On a tangential note, I just realized that I should probably put together a simple recipe for how to bootstrap this site should it ever disappear.  I have the posts archived on my GitHub, and you can use Jekyll and the jekyll-swiss theme in black to regenerate the static site. From there, it's just a matter of dropping the static files into an nginx html folder and making sure everything is https-enabled.

Moving challenge: defeated! Next stop: getting some real content up on here. I'll be interning at Ithaka Harbors, the parent company of JSTOR, this summer, which should provide me with plenty of material to post about here.

To anyone from Ithaka reading this: No, I'm not talking trade secrets! Just lessons learned from working on a real software dev team.

Signing off for now,
