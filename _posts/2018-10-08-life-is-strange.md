It beats you down, then reaches out with a hand just as you're really in the pits.  Life is strange, difficult, and painful, a constant struggle to keep your head above water.  I think it's still worth it, despite all the obstacles.  However, I'm realizing that I need better mechanisms for dealing with the worse parts of life.

Listening to music helps me cope, certainly.  Socializing - in real life, not online - is another strong strategy.  Nothing beats hanging out with friends and shooting the breeze about our terrible weeks and the insane hoops we need to jump through as young adults in 2018.  It definitely helps keep me sane and centered. 

Being online doesn't necessarily help, though. I feel like this is one of the reasons I'm glad I'm not on Facebook; it definitely doesn't fill the gap of social interactions, and I can't imagine going on there to feel better about myself.  Reading posts doesn't make me feel anything.  It's just more text on a screen, the stuff I spend reading all day anyways.  There's no change from the status quo, nothing to make me snap out of a funk, no new input to prompt a change in my internal state machine.  Technology does not have the answer to depression, as much as Silicon Valley would like to disagree with "self-care" apps and smart lamps that simulate daylight.

The point of this rambling stream-of-consciousness post is that I feel like garbage sometimes.  Everyone does.  It's OK, you're not alone, and it can and will go away.  Log off and talk to someone.  Express your emotions to another human being, face-to-face.  Talk it out, and if you can't, do something to take your mind off it.  Listen to music you love, do something simple that makes you feel productive.  Don't wallow in the funk - it doesn't help.
